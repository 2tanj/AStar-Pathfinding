# Interacitve Pathfinding Visualisation
2D Pathfinding visualization implemented using the A* algorithm. The user has the option to
add and edit types of tiles, change the size of the board and change the start and target
positions. The path can be shown in real time or step by step.

The algorithm was written with readability and simplicity in mind, it's not made to be the most
efficient it can be. It can get laggy with big board sizes on weaker machines.
